        <li>9-12 lasagne sheets (depending on the size of your baking dish)</li>
        <li>50g Parmesan, grate</li>
        <li>150g pack mozzarella, shredded</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p><h3>For the white sauce</h3></p>

    <p><ul>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>50g plain flour</li>
        <li>550ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><h2>Method</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. </li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden.</li>
        <li>Turn up the heat, pour in the wine and bubble until reduced.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. </li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat twice</li>
        <li>Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.
